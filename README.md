# xrd-simulate
MATLAB Code to Simulate Basic XRD Patterns

## Getting Started
This collection of MATLAB scripts is designed to simulate XRD patterns using the basic theory x-ray interaction with atoms in a bulk material. The calculations are based off of information that can be found in Structure of Materials: An Introduction to Crystallography, Diffraction, and Symmetry by Marc De Gaef and Michael E. McHenry. 

If the user is unfamiliar with the basics mathematics behind XRD diffraction a brief math section is provided below. If the user is unfamiliar with crystallography the McHenry text or another basic text is strongly suggested. 

## Installing
The script **XRD_Intensity_Simulation.m** controls the entirity of the simulation. To begin the program simply run this script with the following functions and files in the same directory:
- dialogue.m
- dspace.m
- theta_s_calc.m
- scatterfactor.m
- scatterfactorcalc.m
- Scatteringdata.xlsx
- structurefactor.m
- intensitycalc.m
- lorentz.m
- compareintensity.m
